Dart-Zoomable-Svg-Canvas
========================

An infinitely zoomable canvas similar to how Prezi presentations work. It is completely written in Google Dart and doesn't use any dependencies. The animation and zooming is completely done with scripting which makes it possible to run in all modern browsers.
